## 🧠 **What the App Can Do (In One Flow)**

From splash screen to closing the deal, every pixel and line of code in this app is crafted to serve a real-world real estate experience:

### 👀 **Explore & Discover**

Users can seamlessly browse hundreds of properties, intelligently filtered through criteria like:

* **City** 🌆
* **Price range** 💰
* **Bedrooms** 🛏️
* **Bathrooms** 🚿
* **Property type** (Villa, Apartment, Mansion, etc.) 🏘️

Responsive filters update a **RecyclerView** dynamically, with fallback states (like *'No Properties Found'*) handled elegantly.

### ❤️ **Favorites That Stick**

Properties can be added to or removed from the user's favorites with a simple tap. The state syncs instantly to the backend and visually toggles the like button. Persistent favorite logic is backed by **MySQL** and synced through **POST** requests.

### 🧩 **Property Detail View**

Tap any listing to dive into:

* **High-res images** 🖼️ (via **Glide**)
* Structured details: area, views, date built, and more 📋
* Instant contact options: **Call** 📞, **Email** 📧, **WhatsApp** 💬

### ✍️ **Create & Manage Properties**

Logged-in users (**owners**) can:

* **Upload listings** (via form inputs and image picker/camera integration) 📷
* **Update or delete** them 🧼
* **Preview and control visibility** of every detail 🧾

Form validation is deeply embedded to ensure data accuracy. Image files are processed and transmitted via custom **Volley multipart requests**.

### 🧑‍💼 **Personal Profile & Session Management**

Users can:

* **Edit profile info** (name, password, email, etc.)
* **See their properties** (with full edit/delete control)
* **Logout securely** 🔒

Session handling is **local-first**, using a **User class** abstraction and validated remotely before committing actions.

## 🛠️ **Under the Hood**

### **Backend Infrastructure**

* **XAMPP** simulates a full-stack environment.
* **PHP scripts** act as secure, modular interfaces to the database.
* **MySQL** tables store and manage estates, users, views, favorites.

### **Example Endpoints:**

* `add_property.php`
* `upload_image.php`
* `get_all_estates.php`
* `get_favorites.php`
* `update_user_profile.php`

Each endpoint returns **standardized JSON** responses, optimized for fast **Volley parsing**.

## 🧩 **Design Philosophy**

We didn’t just code features—we architected experiences:

* **Fail-safe UI logic** to catch and handle edge cases (e.g., empty filters, missing images).
* **Scalable adapter patterns** for both horizontal and vertical **RecyclerViews**.
* **Separation of concerns** between **UI logic**, **network calls**, and **user session**.
* **Optimized performance** using **local caching strategies**, **lazy image loading**, and **context-bound ViewHolder patterns**.
